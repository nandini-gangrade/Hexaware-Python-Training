1. Define:
 - Clearly articulate the problem to be solved.
 - Understand the objectives and requirements from stakeholders.
2. Analyze:
 - Gather relevant data and information related to the problem.
 - Identify patterns, trends, and potential root causes.
3. Design:
 - Create a high-level plan or concept for solving the problem.
 - Start with broader strokes, outlining major components or steps.
 - Gradually refine the design, considering specific details and potential challenges.
4. Seeing Possible Outcomes:
 - Conduct scenario analysis or use other techniques to envision different outcomes.
 - Embrace an iterative approach to refine the design based on potential scenarios.
5. Decide the Solution:
 - Finalize the design by evaluating it against stakeholder needs and requirements.
 - Seek feedback from clients or relevant parties to validate the proposed solution.
6. Implementation:
 - Translate the finalized design into action, typically through coding or other means.
 - Follow best practices and methodologies during implementation.
7. Follow Up:
 - Test the implemented solution to ensure it meets quality standards and functions as intended.
 - Deploy the solution into the relevant environment.
 - Gather feedback from users or stakeholders and incorporate it for continuous improvement.

This structured approach ensures thorough problem understanding, thoughtful solution design, and effective implementation, leading to successful outcomes.

### Performance Measure
-> mail your manager your highlights (what extra you've done) - cuz of this you've prepared points for yearly meeting like what  you've contributed. (not expected from you but help you)

1. Timeliness: Timeliness measures how promptly tasks or projects are completed within the specified timeframe. For example, if a software developer consistently delivers their assigned tasks before the deadline, they demonstrate high timeliness.
2. Quality of Work: Quality of work assesses the standard and accuracy of the output produced. For instance, if a graphic designer consistently creates visually appealing and error-free designs that meet or exceed client expectations, they exhibit high quality of work.
3. Customer Orientation: Customer orientation evaluates how well an individual or team understands and meets the needs of their customers or clients. For example, a customer service representative who actively listens to customer concerns, provides helpful solutions, and ensures customer satisfaction demonstrates strong customer orientation.
4. Optimal Solution: Optimal solution measures the effectiveness and efficiency of the solutions provided to solve problems or address challenges. For instance, if a data analyst devises a data processing algorithm that significantly reduces processing time and resource utilization while maintaining accuracy, they achieve an optimal solution.
5. Team Satisfaction: Team satisfaction evaluates the morale, collaboration, and overall happiness of team members. For example, if a project manager fosters a positive work environment, encourages open communication, and ensures that team members feel valued and supported, they contribute to high team satisfaction.

These performance measures help organizations gauge the effectiveness, efficiency, and alignment of individuals or teams with organizational goals and objectives.

### Types of Problem

1. *concurrent*
    - Concurrent problems involve multiple tasks or processes that can potentially run simultaneously or concurrently.
    - These tasks may share resources, such as memory or files, and may need to coordinate with each other to avoid conflicts and ensure correctness.
    - Examples of concurrent problems include multi-threading in software applications, concurrent access to shared data structures, and distributed computing tasks.

2. *sequential*
   - Sequential problems involve tasks or processes that must be executed in a specific order, one after the other, without any parallel execution.
   - These problems typically have a clear sequence of steps or dependencies that must be followed.
   - Examples of sequential problems include sorting algorithms like bubble sort or insertion sort, where each step depends on the result of the previous step.

3. *Distributed Problems:*
   - Distributed problems involve tasks or processes that are spread across multiple computers or nodes in a network.
   - These tasks often require communication and coordination between different nodes to achieve a common goal.
   - Examples of distributed problems include distributed databases, distributed file systems, and distributed computing tasks such as map-reduce.

4. *Event-Based Problems:*
   - Event-based problems involve responding to events or triggers that occur asynchronously.
   - These events can come from various sources, such as user input, hardware interrupts, or messages from other processes.
   - Event-based systems typically use event loops or callback mechanisms to handle events as they occur.
   - Examples of event-based problems include graphical user interfaces (GUIs), network servers handling incoming requests, and real-time systems reacting to sensor data.

Each type of problem requires different approaches and techniques for solution development, and understanding the characteristics of each can help in choosing the most appropriateÂ strategy.

### How does App work

 - Concurrent: Simultaneous handling of multiple user requests, ensuring data integrity.
Example: Managing orders from multiple users placed simultaneously.
 - Sequential: Tasks executed in a specific order for order processing and transaction integrity.
Example: Verifying item availability, calculating total price, processing payment, and confirming orders.
 - Distributed: Operating across multiple interconnected servers to handle high traffic and ensure scalability.
Example: Servers distributed geographically to serve users in different regions.
 - Event-Based: Asynchronous response to events or triggers for real-time updates and notifications.
Example: Generating notifications to kitchen staff and updating order status in real-time when a new order is placed.

## Problem Solving Methods

**1. Brute force:**   Brute force involves trying every possible solution to a problem until a satisfactory one is found. <br>
Example: To find the maximum value in an array, you iterate through each element and compare it with the current maximum value.

**2. Greedy:**
   Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. <br>
   Example: The greedy algorithm for the "Coin Change" problem selects the largest coin denomination that is less than or equal to the remaining amount at each step.

**3. Divide and Conquer:**
Divide and conquer involves breaking a problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems, solving them recursively, and combining their solutions to solve the original problem. <br>
Example: Merge Sort divides an array into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the sorted halves.

**4. Dynamic Programming:**
Dynamic programming solves problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.(pattern - no. of ways) <br>
Example: The Fibonacci sequence can be efficiently calculated using dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations of Fibonacci numbers.

Each of these problem-solving methods has its strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the appropriate method depends on the nature of the problem and its constraints.
