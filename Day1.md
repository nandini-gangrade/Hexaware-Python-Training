1. Timeliness: Timeliness measures how promptly tasks or projects are completed within the specified timeframe. For example, if a software developer consistently delivers their assigned tasks before the deadline, they demonstrate high timeliness.
2. Quality of Work: Quality of work assesses the standard and accuracy of the output produced. For instance, if a graphic designer consistently creates visually appealing and error-free designs that meet or exceed client expectations, they exhibit high quality of work.
3. Customer Orientation: Customer orientation evaluates how well an individual or team understands and meets the needs of their customers or clients. For example, a customer service representative who actively listens to customer concerns, provides helpful solutions, and ensures customer satisfaction demonstrates strong customer orientation.
4. Optimal Solution: Optimal solution measures the effectiveness and efficiency of the solutions provided to solve problems or address challenges. For instance, if a data analyst devises a data processing algorithm that significantly reduces processing time and resource utilization while maintaining accuracy, they achieve an optimal solution.
5. Team Satisfaction: Team satisfaction evaluates the morale, collaboration, and overall happiness of team members. For example, if a project manager fosters a positive work environment, encourages open communication, and ensures that team members feel valued and supported, they contribute to high team satisfaction.

These performance measures help organizations gauge the effectiveness, efficiency, and alignment of individuals or teams with organizational goals and objectives.

2. *sequential*
   - Sequential problems involve tasks or processes that must be executed in a specific order, one after the other, without any parallel execution.
   - These problems typically have a clear sequence of steps or dependencies that must be followed.
   - Examples of sequential problems include sorting algorithms like bubble sort or insertion sort, where each step depends on the result of the previous step.

4. *Event-Based Problems:*
   - Event-based problems involve responding to events or triggers that occur asynchronously.
   - These events can come from various sources, such as user input, hardware interrupts, or messages from other processes.
   - Event-based systems typically use event loops or callback mechanisms to handle events as they occur.
   - Examples of event-based problems include graphical user interfaces (GUIs), network servers handling incoming requests, and real-time systems reacting to sensor data.

 - Concurrent: Simultaneous handling of multiple user requests, ensuring data integrity.
Example: Managing orders from multiple users placed simultaneously.
 - Sequential: Tasks executed in a specific order for order processing and transaction integrity.
Example: Verifying item availability, calculating total price, processing payment, and confirming orders.
 - Distributed: Operating across multiple interconnected servers to handle high traffic and ensure scalability.
Example: Servers distributed geographically to serve users in different regions.
 - Event-Based: Asynchronous response to events or triggers for real-time updates and notifications.
Example: Generating notifications to kitchen staff and updating order status in real-time when a new order is placed.

## 4. Problem Solving Methods

**1. Brute force:**   Brute force involves trying every possible solution to a problem until a satisfactory one is found. <br>
Example: To find the maximum value in an array, you iterate through each element and compare it with the current maximum value.

   ![image](https://github.com/nandini-gangrade/Hexaware-Python-Training/assets/87817417/17e75afd-62a3-4fb8-8bdf-40feaa716b58)

**2. Greedy:**
   Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. <br>
   Example: The greedy algorithm for the "Coin Change" problem selects the largest coin denomination that is less than or equal to the remaining amount at each step.

**3. Divide and Conquer:**
Divide and conquer involves breaking a problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems, solving them recursively, and combining their solutions to solve the original problem. <br>
Example: Merge Sort divides an array into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the sorted halves.

![image](https://github.com/nandini-gangrade/Hexaware-Python-Training/assets/87817417/920508d0-f4d0-43f5-9bf9-a96b7d720c31)

**4. Dynamic Programming:**
Dynamic programming solves problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.(pattern - no. of ways) <br>
Example: The Fibonacci sequence can be efficiently calculated using dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations of Fibonacci numbers.

Each of these problem-solving methods has its strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the appropriate method depends on the nature of the problem and its constraints.

## 5. Modeling Tools

**1. Flow Charts:**
Flow charts are graphical representations of processes or workflows. They use different shapes to represent various steps, decisions, and actions in a process, connected by arrows indicating the flow. <br>
Example: Flow chart for an online shopping process, showing steps like selecting items, adding to cart, checkout, and payment. <br>

**2. Data Flow Diagrams (DFD):**
DFDs depict the flow of data through a system. They illustrate how data is input, processed, stored, and outputted within a system or process. DFDs consist of processes, data stores, data flows, and external entities. <br>
Example: DFD for a student registration system, showing processes like student registration, course selection, and generating student IDs. <br>
