  - Development Team: Continues to maintain and support the software, addressing issues and making updates.
  - Operations Team: Ensures ongoing availability, performance, and security of the software in production environments.

# Waterfall And Agile Methodologies
![WhatsApp Image 2024-04-23 at 16 53 54_829b7117](https://github.com/nandini-gangrade/Hexaware-Python-Training/assets/87817417/970c5d78-fe54-4e6e-806a-bebf293d2ff1)

The main differences between the Waterfall and Agile software development methodologies:

| Aspect          | Waterfall Methodology                            | Agile Methodology                             |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Approach**    | Sequential, linear approach.                     | Iterative and incremental approach.          |
| **Flexibility** | Less flexible, changes are difficult to accommodate once the development phase begins. | More flexible, changes can be accommodated easily even late in the development cycle. |
| **Requirements**| All requirements are gathered upfront and documented in detail. | Requirements are gathered incrementally and can evolve throughout the project. |
| **Delivery**    | Final product is delivered at the end of the development cycle. | Product features are delivered incrementally in short iterations, often in 2-4 weeks. |
| **Feedback**    | Limited customer involvement until the end of the project. | Continuous customer feedback and collaboration throughout the project. |
| **Risk**        | Higher risk of late-stage project failures.      | Risks are mitigated early through iterative development and frequent testing. |
| **Adaptability**| Less adaptable to changes in project scope or requirements. | Adaptable to changes, priorities, and customer feedback. |
| **Team Size**   | Suitable for large, well-defined projects with stable requirements. | Suited for small to medium-sized projects with evolving requirements. |
| **Documentation**| Extensive documentation at each stage of the process. | Emphasis on working software over comprehensive documentation. |
