| Key Type       | Definition                                                                                                                                                     | Example                                                                                     | Usage and Significance                                                                                       |

| Primary Key    | A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures data integrity by preventing duplicate entries.                                    | `EmpID` in Employees table                                                                  | Used to uniquely identify each record in the table and establish relationships with other tables.           |
| Candidate Key  | A candidate key is a set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple (row) in a relation (table).                                                        | `{EmpLicence}` in Employees table                                                           | Serves as potential primary keys; ensures each row can be uniquely identified.                               |
| Foreign Key    | A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It enforces referential integrity in database relationships. | `Did` in Employees table, referencing `Did` in Designation table                           | Establishes relationships between tables; ensures data consistency by linking related information.           |
| Alternate Key  | An alternate key is a candidate key that was not chosen as the primary key.                                                                                   | `{EmpPassport}` in Employees table                                                          | Provides alternative unique identifiers if the primary key is not suitable for certain operations.          |
| Super Key      | A super key is a set of attributes within a table whose values can uniquely identify each row. It may contain more attributes than necessary for uniqueness.       | `{EmpID, EmpName}` in Employees table                                                        | Acts as a broader identifier than the primary key; useful in indexing and query optimization.               |
| Unique Key     | A unique key constraint ensures that all values in a column or a group of columns are unique. Unlike a primary key, a table can have multiple unique keys.        | `Designation` in Designation table                                                          | Ensures uniqueness within specified columns; useful for enforcing data integrity and constraints.           |
| Composite Key  | A composite key is a combination of two or more columns that together uniquely identify each row in a table.                                                  | `{EmpID, EmpLicence}` in Employees table                                                     | Ensures uniqueness by combining multiple attributes; used when no single attribute can uniquely identify each row.  |
