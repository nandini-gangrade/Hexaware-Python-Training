# LIMIT, OFFSET, FETCH & DECLARE


## Pagination in SQL: 
Pagination is the process of dividing a large set of query results into smaller, manageable chunks or pages. It allows users to navigate through a large dataset systematically, typically by limiting the number of rows returned per page and providing options to navigate to the next or previous pages.

| `LIMIT` (MySQL)    | Limits the number of rows returned in a query     | Implementing pagination, preventing large result sets, improving performance   | MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite                        | Provides control over the number of rows returned, facilitating efficient querying    |
| `TOP` (T-SQL)      | Retrieves the specified number of rows            | Obtaining a limited set of rows from a query result                           | SQL Server (T-SQL)                               | Useful for limiting the result set size, especially when combined with ORDER BY clause |
| `OFFSET` (T-SQL)   | Skips a specified number of rows in a result set  | Implementing pagination, skipping initial rows                                  | SQL Server (T-SQL)                               | Useful for navigating through large result sets, particularly for paginated views       |
| `FETCH` (T-SQL)    | Retrieves a specified number of rows from a result set | Implementing pagination, fetching a fixed number of rows from a query result | SQL Server (T-SQL)                               | Provides a more concise syntax for limiting and fetching rows from a query result     |
| `DECLARE` (T-SQL)  | Declares a variable for use within a batch or stored procedure | Storing and manipulating temporary values, performing conditional logic         | SQL Server (T-SQL)                               | Enables dynamic SQL queries, parameterizing queries, and temporary storage of values  |

**Usage:**
- `LIMIT` is primarily used in MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite to limit the number of rows returned by a query. It's commonly used for implementing pagination or restricting large result sets.
- `TOP` is specific to SQL Server (T-SQL) and is used to retrieve a specified number of rows from a query result. It's helpful for obtaining a limited set of rows, especially when combined with the `ORDER BY` clause.
- `OFFSET` and `FETCH` are also T-SQL features used for pagination. `OFFSET` skips a specified number of rows in the result set, while `FETCH` retrieves a specified number of rows after the `OFFSET`. Together, they allow for efficient navigation through large result sets.
- `DECLARE` is a T-SQL statement used to declare variables within a batch or stored procedure. It's essential for storing and manipulating temporary values, performing conditional logic, and parameterizing queries.

**Why:**
- These features provide control over the result set size, facilitating efficient querying and improving database performance.
- Pagination techniques like `OFFSET` and `FETCH` are crucial for navigating through large datasets, providing users with a better browsing experience.
- `DECLARE` allows for the dynamic creation of variables, enabling the execution of dynamic SQL queries and parameterization of queries, which enhances code reusability and maintainability.

### SQL Commands:

#### 1. **Using `TOP` to Limit Rows:**
   ```sql
   SELECT TOP 5 * FROM Employees;
   ```
   **Purpose:** The purpose of this command is to retrieve a limited number of rows from the "Employees" table, specifically the top 5 rows.

   **Explanation:** This query selects the top 5 rows from the "Employees" table.

   **Generated Table:**
   | EmployeeID | Name       | Salary   | DepartmentID |
   |------------|------------|----------|--------------|

#### 2. **Using `TOP` with `ORDER BY` for Pagination:**
   ```sql
   SELECT TOP 5 * FROM Employees ORDER BY EmployeeID OFFSET 5 ROWS;
   ```
   **Purpose:** This command is used for pagination, retrieving the next set of rows after skipping the first 5 rows, ordered by `EmployeeID`.

   **Explanation:** This query selects the next 5 rows from the "Employees" table after skipping the first 5 rows. It orders the results by `EmployeeID`.

   **Generated Table:**
   | EmployeeID | Name             | Salary   | DepartmentID |
   |------------|------------------|----------|--------------|
   | 6          | Michael Davis    | 58000.00 | 102          |

#### 3. **Using `OFFSET FETCH` for Pagination:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY EmployeeID OFFSET 5 ROWS FETCH NEXT 5 ROWS ONLY;
   ```
   **Purpose:** This command is also used for pagination, skipping the first 5 rows and fetching the next 5 rows from the "Employees" table, ordered by `EmployeeID`.

   **Explanation:** This query skips the first 5 rows and then fetches the next 5 rows from the "Employees" table. It orders the results by `EmployeeID`.

   **Generated Table:**
   | EmployeeID | Name             | Salary   | DepartmentID |
   |------------|------------------|----------|--------------|
   | 6          | Michael Davis    | 58000.00 | 102          |
   | 7          | Jessica Martinez | 53000.00 | 103          |
   | 8          | David Rodriguez  | 51000.00 | 101          |
   | 9          | Maria Garcia     | 59000.00 | 102          |
   | 10         | James Wilson     | 54000.00 | 103          |

#### 4. **Select Top 3 Purchase Amount from Orders:**
   ```sql
   SELECT TOP 3 purch_amt FROM orders ORDER BY purch_amt DESC;
   ```
   **Purpose:** This command retrieves the top 3 purchase amounts from the "Orders" table, ordered by purchase amount in descending order.

   **Explanation:** This query selects the top 3 purchase amounts from the "Orders" table and orders them in descending order.

   **Generated Table:**
   | purch_amt |
   |-----------|
   | 576000    |
   | 304560    |
   | 2450-40   |

#### 5. **Format Date as 25 Apr 2012:**
   ```sql
   DECLARE @date DATE = '2012-04-25';
   SELECT FORMAT(@date, 'dd MMM yyyy') AS FormattedDate;
   ```
   **Purpose:** This command declares a variable `@date` with the value '2012-04-25' and then formats it as '25 Apr 2012'.

   **Explanation:** The date '2012-04-25' is declared as a variable `@date` and then formatted as '25 Apr 2012' using the `FORMAT` function.

   **Formatted Date:** 25 Apr 2012

   **Generated Table for Formatted Date:**
   | FormattedDate |
   |---------------|
   | 25 Apr 2012   |

#### 6. **Select Top N Orders with Formatted Date:**
   ```sql
   DECLARE @n INT = 5;  -- Variable to store the number of top orders to fetch

   SELECT FORMAT(ord_date, 'dd MMM yyyy') AS FormattedDate
   FROM orders
   ORDER BY purch_amt DESC
   OFFSET 0 ROWS
   FETCH NEXT @n ROWS ONLY;
   ```
   **Purpose:** This command retrieves the top N orders from the "Orders" table and formats their order dates.

   **Explanation:** It first declares a variable `@n` to store the number of top orders to fetch. Then it selects the top N rows from the "Orders" table, orders them by purchase amount in descending order, and formats their order dates as 'dd MMM yyyy'.

   **Generated Table for Formatted Date:**
   | FormattedDate |
   |---------------|
   | 25 Apr 2012   |

> This command demonstrates the use of variables (`DECLARE`) in SQL to parameterize queries and make them more flexible. By declaring a variable `@n`, we can easily change the number of top orders to fetch without modifying the query structure. The `FORMAT` function is used to format the order dates according to the specified format ('dd MMM yyyy'). Finally, the `OFFSET` and `FETCH NEXT` clauses are used to implement pagination and limit the number of rows returned by the query.

**Purpose of the Exercise:** The purpose of this exercise is to learn and understand different methods for limiting and paginating query results in SQL, such as using `TOP`, `OFFSET`, `FETCH`, `DECLARE`, and `LIMIT`. These techniques are commonly used for optimizing database performance and enhancing user experience, especially when dealing with large datasets or implementing pagination in web applications.

- **`TOP`:** Used in T-SQL to limit the number of rows returned by a query.
- **`OFFSET` and `FETCH`:** Used in T-SQL to implement pagination by skipping a certain number of rows and then fetching a specified number of rows.
- **`DECLARE`:** Used in T-SQL to declare variables for use within a script or batch.
- **`LIMIT`:** Used in other SQL dialects (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to limit the number of rows returned by a query.

Understanding these techniques and their variations is crucial for efficient data retrieval and manipulation in SQL databases.
